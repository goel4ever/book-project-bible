# Security Camera

##### Purpose

Get a quick hands-on on topics like 3D printing, Raspberry Pi with cloud connectivity and at the same time build a low budget security camera with motion detection costing around $25 \(I'll add the breakdown as I start building the project\).

> **Caution:** Based on feedbacks online, it is possible that Pi zero heats up. See if you can find a way to install heat-sink in existing design.

##### Material Required

* STL files for 3D printing
* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Raspberry Pi Camera
* Micro-USB power cable

##### Material Location
