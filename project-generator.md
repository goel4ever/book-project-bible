# Project Generator

When you are learning languages/frameworks, getting all the pieces together is what takes up most time. This is the last thing you want to slow yourself down. Project generator is meant to solve that problem for all my personal projects.

To create your own, you should be familiar with:

* NodeJS
* JavaScript
* NPM
* Basic Linux command line
